I do not have a lot of information here because the first part was really easy, 
you learn how to create and use Functions, conditionals and bucles like while, for.
You also learn how reserved words (Those that cannot be used to name a variable of function)
You learn how to print and ask for information

All that i have learned in another course, so I think it might be repetitive if I 
wrote the codes again.
