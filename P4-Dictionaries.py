#dictionaries
# is a data structure, it allow us to "label" a different
# type of values, in dictionaries, the label must not repeat
# it does not have an order
#to write a dictionary, u must put a word in, and the 
# dictionary will give you a value out
# we define a dictionary with dict(), or with {}
